Final Sanity CheckUse this checklist to ensure all repository components are correctly configured and work together as a cohesive system before starting development.1. Core Repository Structure[ ] Is there a config/ directory?[ ] Is there a scripts/ directory?[ ] Is there a .github/workflows/ directory?[ ] Is there a PROGRESS_LOGS/ directory with new/ and processed/ subdirectories?[ ] Is the LICENSE file absent (to ensure default copyright for a commercial project)?2. Configuration Files (config/)[ ] checklist.yml:[ ] Do all agent name fields accurately and generically describe their function?[ ] Do the dependencies for each task make logical sense?[ ] Is the status for all tasks set to 0 initially?[ ] agents.md:[ ] Is the language generic (e.g., "product" instead of "drug")?[ ] Does every agent have a clear "Completion Protocol" section?[ ] Does the "Completion Protocol" correctly reference writing a log to PROGRESS_LOGS/new/?3. Automation Scripts (scripts/)[ ] propose_next_tasks.py:[ ] Does it correctly point to config/checklist.yml to read its input?[ ] Does it correctly write its output to NEXT_ACTIONS.md in the root directory?[ ] Does it have the pyyaml dependency noted for installation?[ ] update_progress.py:[ ] Does it read from PROGRESS_LOGS/new/?[ ] Does it move processed files to PROGRESS_LOGS/processed/?[ ] Does it correctly write its output to PROGRESS.md in the root directory?[ ] Does it have the pyyaml dependency noted?4. GitHub Actions Workflows (.github/workflows/)[ ] progress_updater.yml:[ ] Does it correctly call scripts/update_progress.py?[ ] Does it have a step to install pyyaml?[ ] Is it set to trigger on workflow_dispatch (manual run)?[ ] task_proposer.yml:[ ] Does it correctly call scripts/propose_next_tasks.py?[ ] Does it have a step to install pyyaml?[ ] Is it set to trigger on workflow_dispatch?5. Root Files[ ] README.md: Does it accurately reflect the final architecture (config vs. scripts, GitHub Actions)?[ ] .gitignore: Does it correctly ignore .env files and __pycache__?[ ] PROGRESS.md & NEXT_ACTIONS.md: Are they present as placeholder files, explaining that they are auto-generated?
